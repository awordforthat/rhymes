          THE WELSH MARCHES

          High the vanes of Shrewsbury gleam
          Islanded in Severn stream;
          The bridges from the steepled crest
          Cross the water east and west.

          The flag of morn in conqueror's state
          Enters at the English gate:
          The vanquished eve, as night prevails,
          Bleeds upon the road to Wales.

          Ages since the vanquished bled
          Round my mother's marriage-bed;
          There the ravens feasted far
          About the open house of war:

          When Severn down to Buildwas ran
          Coloured with the death of man,
          Couched upon her brother's grave
          The Saxon got me on the slave.

          The sound of fight is silent long
          That began the ancient wrong;
          Long the voice of tears is still
          That wept of old the endless ill.

          In my heart it has not died,
          The war that sleeps on Severn side;
          They cease not fighting, east and west,
          On the marches of my breast.

          Here the truceless armies yet
          Trample, rolled in blood and sweat;
          They kill and kill and never die;
          And I think that each is I.

          None will part us, none undo
          The knot that makes one flesh of two,
          Sick with hatred, sick with pain,
          Strangling-When shall we be slain?

          When shall I be dead and rid
          Of the wrong my father did?
          How long, how long, till spade and hearse
          Put to sleep my mother's curse?
