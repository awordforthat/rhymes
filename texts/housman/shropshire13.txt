          There pass the careless people
           That call their souls their own:
          Here by the road I loiter,
           How idle and alone.

          Ah, past the plunge of plummet,
           In seas I cannot sound,
          My heart and soul and senses,
           World without end, are drowned.

          His folly has not fellow
           Beneath the blue of day
          That gives to man or woman
           His heart and soul away.

          There flowers no balm to sain him
           From east of earth to west
          That's lost for everlasting
           The heart out of his breast.

          Here by the labouring highway
           With empty hands I stroll:
          Sea-deep, till doomsday morning,
           Lie lost my heart and soul.
