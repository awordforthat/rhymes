          Say, lad, have you things to do?
           Quick then, while your day's at prime.
          Quick, and if 'tis work for two,
           Here am I, man: now's your time.

          Send me now, and I shall go;
           Call me, I shall hear you call;
          Use me ere they lay me low
           Where a man's no use at all;

          Ere the wholesome flesh decay,
           And the willing nerve be numb,
          And the lips lack breath to say,
           "No, my lad, I cannot come."
