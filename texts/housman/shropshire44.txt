          If it chance your eye offend you,
           Pluck it out, lad, and be sound:
          'Twill hurt, but here are salves to friend you,
           And many a balsam grows on ground.

          And if your hand or foot offend you,
           Cut it off, lad, and be whole;
          But play the man, stand up and end you,
           When your sickness is your soul.
