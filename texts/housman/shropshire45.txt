           Bring, in this timeless grave to throw,
          No cypress, sombre on the snow;
          Snap not from the bitter yew
          His leaves that live December through;
          Break no rosemary, bright with rime
          And sparkling to the cruel clime;
          Nor plod the winter land to look
          For willows in the icy brook
          To cast them leafless round him: bring
          No spray that ever buds in spring.

           But if the Christmas field has kept
          Awns the last gleaner overstept,
          Or shrivelled flax, whose flower is blue
          A single season, never two;
          Or if one haulm whose year is o'er
          Shivers on the upland frore,
          -Oh, bring from hill and stream and plain
          Whatever will not flower again,
          To give him comfort: he and those
          Shall bide eternal bedfellows
          Where low upon the couch he lies
          Whence he never shall arise.
