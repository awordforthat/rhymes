          On moonlit heath and lonesome bank
           The sheep beside me graze;
          And yon the gallows used to clank
           Fast by the four cross ways.

          A careless shepherd once would keep
           The flocks by moonlight there, (1)
          And high amongst the glimmering sheep
           The dead man stood on air.

          They hang us now in Shrewsbury jail:
           The whistles blow forlorn,
          And trains all night groan on the rail
           To men that die at morn.

          There sleeps in Shrewsbury jail to-night,
           Or wakes, as may betide,
          A better lad, if things went right,
           Than most that sleep outside.

          And naked to the hangman's noose
           The morning clocks will ring
          A neck God made for other use
           Than strangling in a string.

          And sharp the link of life will snap,
           And dead on air will stand
          Heels that held up as straight a chap
           As treads upon the land.

          So here I'll watch the night and wait
           To see the morning shine,
          When he will hear the stroke of eight
           And not the stroke of nine;

          And wish my friend as sound a sleep
           As lads' I did not know,
          That shepherded the moonlit sheep
           A hundred years ago.

          (1) Hanging in chains was called keeping sheep by moonlight.
