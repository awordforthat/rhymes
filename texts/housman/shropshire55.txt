          THE DAY OF BATTLE

          "Far I hear the bugle blow
          To call me where I would not go,
          And the guns begin the song,
          'Soldier, fly or stay for long.'"

          "Comrade, if to turn and fly
          Made a soldier never die,
          Fly I would, for who would not?
          'Tis sure no pleasure to be shot."

          "But since the man that runs away
          Lives to die another day,
          And cowards' funerals, when they come
          Are not wept so well at home."

          "Therefore, though the best is bad,
          Stand and do the best my lad;
          Stand and fight and see your slain,
          And take the bullet in your brain."
