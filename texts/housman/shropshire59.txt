          Now hollow fires burn out to black,
           And lights are guttering low:
          Square your shoulders, lift your pack,
           And leave your friends and go.

          Oh never fear, man, nought's to dread,
           Look not left nor right:
          In all the endless road you tread
           There's nothing but the night.
