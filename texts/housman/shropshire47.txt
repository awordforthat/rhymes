          Be still, my soul, be still; the arms you bear are brittle,
           Earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong.
          Think rather,-call to thought, if now you grieve a little,
           The days when we had rest, O soul, for they were long.

          Men loved unkindness then, but lightless in the quarry
           I slept and saw not; tears fell down, I did not mourn;
          Sweat ran and blood sprang out and I was never sorry:
           Then it was well with me, in days ere I was born.

          Now, and I muse for why and never find the reason,
           I pace the earth, and drink the air, and feel the sun.
          Be still, be still, my soul; it is but for a season:
           Let us endure an hour and see injustice done.

          Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation;
           All thoughts to rive the heart are here, and all are vain:
          Horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation-
           Oh why did I awake? when shall I sleep again?
