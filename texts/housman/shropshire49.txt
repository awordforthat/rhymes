          _ Clunton and Clunbury,
           Clungunford and Clun,
          Are the quietest places
           Under the sun. _

          In valleys of springs of rivers,
           By Ony and Teme and Clun,
          The country for easy livers,
           The quietest under the sun,

          We still had sorrows to lighten,
           One could not be always glad,
          And lads knew trouble at Knighton
           When I was a Knighton lad.

          By bridges that Thames runs under,
           In London, the town built ill,
          'Tis sure small matter for wonder
           If sorrow is with one still.

          And if as a lad grows older
           The troubles he bears are more,
          He carries his griefs on a shoulder
           That handselled them long before.

          Where shall one halt to deliver
           This luggage I'd lief set down?
          Not Thames, not Teme is the river,
           Nor London nor Knighton the town:

          'Tis a long way further than Knighton,
           A quieter place than Clun,
          Where doomsday may thunder and lighten
           And little 'twill matter to one.
