          THE ISLE OF PORTLAND

          The star-filled seas are smooth to-night
           From France to England strown;
          Black towers above the Portland light
           The felon-quarried stone.

          On yonder island, not to rise,
           Never to stir forth free,
          Far from his folk a dead lad lies
           That once was friends with me.

          Lie you easy, dream you light,
           And sleep you fast for aye;
          And luckier may you find the night
           Than ever you found the day.
