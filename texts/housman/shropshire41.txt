          THE MERRY GUIDE

          Once in the wind of morning
           I ranged the thymy wold;
          The world-wide air was azure
           And all the brooks ran gold.

          There through the dews beside me
           Behold a youth that trod,
          With feathered cap on forehead,
           And poised a golden rod.

          With mien to match the morning
           And gay delightful guise
          And friendly brows and laughter
           He looked me in the eyes.

          Oh whence, I asked, and whither?
           He smiled and would not say,
          And looked at me and beckoned
           And laughed and led the way.

          And with kind looks and laughter
           And nought to say beside
          We two went on together,
           I and my happy guide.

          Across the glittering pastures
           And empty upland still
          And solitude of shepherds
           High in the folded hill,

          By hanging woods and hamlets
           That gaze through orchards down
          On many a windmill turning
           And far-discovered town,

          With gay regards of promise
           And sure unslackened stride
          And smiles and nothing spoken
           Led on my merry guide.

          By blowing realms of woodland
           With sunstruck vanes afield
          And cloud-led shadows sailing
           About the windy weald,

          By valley-guarded granges
           And silver waters wide,
          Content at heart I followed
           With my delightful guide.

          And like the cloudy shadows
           Across the country blown
          We two face on for ever,
           But not we two alone.

          With the great gale we journey
           That breathes from gardens thinned,
          Borne in the drift of blossoms
           Whose petals throng the wind;

          Buoyed on the heaven-heard whisper
           Of dancing leaflets whirled
          From all the woods that autumn
           Bereaves in all the world.

          And midst the fluttering legion
           Of all that ever died
          I follow, and before us
           Goes the delightful guide,

          With lips that brim with laughter
           But never once respond,
          And feet that fly on feathers,
           And serpent-circled wand.
