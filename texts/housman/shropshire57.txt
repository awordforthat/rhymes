          When I came last to Ludlow
           Amidst the moonlight pale,
          Two friends kept step beside me,
           Two honest lads and hale.

          Now Dick lies long in the churchyard,
           And Ned lies long in jail,
          And I come home to Ludlow
           Amidst the moonlight pale.
