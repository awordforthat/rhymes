           In my own shire, if I was sad
          Homely comforters I had:
          The earth, because my heart was sore,
          Sorrowed for the son she bore;
          And standing hills, long to remain,
          Shared their short-lived comrade's pain.
          And bound for the same bourn as I,
          On every road I wandered by,
          Trod beside me, close and dear,
          The beautiful and death-struck year:
          Whether in the woodland brown
          I heard the beechnut rustle down,
          And saw the purple crocus pale
          Flower about the autumn dale;
          Or littering far the fields of May
          Lady-smocks a-bleaching lay,
          And like a skylit water stood
          The bluebells in the azured wood.

           Yonder, lightening other loads,
          The seasons range the country roads,
          But here in London streets I ken
          No such helpmates, only men;
          And these are not in plight to bear,
          If they would, another's care.
          They have enough as 'tis: I see
          In many an eye that measures me
          The mortal sickness of a mind
          Too unhappy to be kind.
          Undone with misery, all they can
          Is to hate their fellow man;
          And till they drop they needs must still
          Look at you and wish you ill.
