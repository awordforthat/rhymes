          On your midnight pallet lying
           Listen, and undo the door:
          Lads that waste the light in sighing
           In the dark should sigh no more;
          Night should ease a lover's sorrow;
          Therefore, since I go to-morrow;
           Pity me before.

          In the land to which I travel,
           The far dwelling, let me say-
          Once, if here the couch is gravel,
           In a kinder bed I lay,
          And the breast the darnel smothers
          Rested once upon another's
           When it was not clay.
