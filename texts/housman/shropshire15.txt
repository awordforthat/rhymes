          It nods and curtseys and recovers
           When the wind blows above,
          The nettle on the graves of lovers
           That hanged themselves for love.

          The nettle nods, the wind blows over,
           The man, he does not move,
          The lover of the grave, the lover
           That hanged himself for love.
