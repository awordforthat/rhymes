           Loitering with a vacant eye
          Along the Grecian gallery,
          And brooding on my heavy ill,
          I met a statue standing still.
          Still in marble stone stood he,
          And stedfastly he looked at me.
          "Well met," I thought the look would say,
          "We both were fashioned far away;
          We neither knew, when we were young,
          These Londoners we live among."

           Still he stood and eyed me hard,
          An earnest and a grave regard:
          "What, lad, drooping with your lot?
          I too would be where I am not.
          I too survey that endless line
          Of men whose thoughts are not as mine.
          Years, ere you stood up from rest,
          On my neck the collar prest;
          Years, when you lay down your ill,
          I shall stand and bear it still.
          Courage, lad, 'tis not for long:
          Stand, quit you like stone, be strong."
          So I thought his look would say;
          And light on me my trouble lay,
          And I slept out in flesh and bone
          Manful like the man of stone.
