          With rue my heart is laden
           For golden friends I had,
          For many a rose-lipt maiden
           And many a lightfoot lad.

          By brooks too broad for leaping
           The lightfoot boys are laid;
          The rose-lipt girls are sleeping
           In fields where roses fade.
