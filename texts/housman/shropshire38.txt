          'Tis time, I think by Wenlock town
           The golden broom should blow;
          The hawthorn sprinkled up and down
           Should charge the land with snow.

          Spring will not wait the loiterer's time
           Who keeps so long away;
          So others wear the broom and climb
           The hedgerows heaped with may.

          Oh tarnish late on Wenlock Edge,
           Gold that I never see;
          Lie long, high snowdrifts in the hedge
           That will not shower on me.
