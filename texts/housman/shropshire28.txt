          THE LENT LILY

          'Tis spring; come out to ramble
           The hilly brakes around,
          For under thorn and bramble
           About the hollow ground
           The primroses are found.

          And there's the windflower chilly
           With all the winds at play,
          And there's the Lenten lily
           That has not long to stay
           And dies on Easter day.

          And since till girls go maying
           You find the primrose still,
          And find the windflower playing
           With every wind at will,
           But not the daffodil,

          Bring baskets now, and sally
           Upon the spring's array,
          And bear from hill and valley
           The daffodil away
           That dies on Easter day.
