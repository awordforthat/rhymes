Be my staple and my stay
Jesus help through each day
as I walk this weary way
upon my soul

and when judgement falls to me
through my saviour shall I be
given peace eternally
upon my soul

upon my soul
upon my free and joyous soul
given peace eternally
upon my soul

Jesus shine your light on me
shine with love and charity
that I might help brothers see
upon my soul

For temptation let me ply
be my wings, Lord, be my eyes
guard me when old Satan's nigh
upon my soul

upon my soul
upon my free and joyous soul
guard me when old Satan's nigh
upon my soul

I shall fill each earhly day
with the singing of his praise
follow in his holy ways
upon my soul

and when I lay my troubles down
on my brow he'll place a crown
and the trumpets all shall sound
upon my soul

upon my soul
upon my free and joyous soul
and the trumpets all shall sound
upon my soul
