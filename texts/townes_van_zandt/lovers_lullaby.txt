Dreams that have flown down the hall
tears that were sown on despair
summer's turned fall
it don't matter at all
when I wake and find you lying there
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair

Blues gonna dance through the sky
time's gonna roll soft as rain
sigh after sigh is gonna pass by and by
ah love's gonna fly on the wind
when I gaze into your brown eyes again

All the things I've seen
and the places that I've been
don't mean a thing since I found you
all that matters now
since I've won your love somehow
are these plans I keep makin'
not to lose you

So sleep till the moon slips away
I'm hopin' all you're dreamin' comes true
when you rise with the day
I might not have too much to say
but you know that doesn't mean
that I don't love you
ah you know that doesn't mean
that I don't love you

All the things I've seen
and the places that I've been
don't mean a thing since I found you
all that matters now
since I've won your love somehow
are these plans I keep makin'
not to lose you

Dreams that have flown down the hall
tears that were sown on despair
summer's turned fall
it don't matter at all
when I wake and find you lying there
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair
Sweet silence and soft auburn hair
