I'm standin' with my bowed head down now
that ain't right that ain't wrong
It's just a feelin' but I can't shake it
I keep on tryin but it's been so long

If I hurt you I did not mean to
I beg you pardon I did not want to
When I leave you don't you think about me
I won't be back babe I'll be long gone

When the time comes and I'm not ready
seems it's over before I'm started
The time comes and I don't feel it
I don't know nothin' but my own

Kingdoms into the sky go
and the highway like a river does flow
and my way sometimes it hurts so
and your way just don't go home
