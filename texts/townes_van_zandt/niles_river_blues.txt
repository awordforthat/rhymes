On the banks of the Niles I courted my love
I walked with her soft as a mournin' dove
I loved her true I swear I still do
and now she's gone without me

I walk by the banks and give the Lord thanks
that I had the chance to court her
I don't know why he flew her away
I don't know why I'm left here

The Niles runs cold and clear
as cold and clear as my tears
I'll never forget, I'll never regret
those days on the beautiful Niles

Her name was Diane her beautiful hands
were soft as the pearls in the water
I looked in her eyes they were blue as the skies
and now I've gone and left her

I'll follow her down the way to the river
follow her now, now and forever
she's my one and only smile
on the beautiful banks of the Niles

Someday soon 'neath the light of the moon
when the sun and the rain shine together
I'll meet her down where the waters flow
and continue to flow forever

Down on the banks of the beautiful Niles
I wonder what I can be thinking
down on the banks of that beautiful river
I'll wander, look for her forever
I'll wander, look for her forever
