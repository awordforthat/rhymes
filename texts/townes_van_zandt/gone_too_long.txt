I been gone too long
too long gone, too long
I been travelin hard
I just can't get back home
it's hard to believe I done all that much wrong

I wanna find me a seven
sevens ain't so bad
seven's about the best friend
this poor boy ever had
you get you a seven
one and six don't seem so sad

I ain't bein' alone
bein' alone too long
I'm sick of singin' this same ol' lonesome song
I'm gonna find me a seven and darlin'
I'm comin' home

It's lonesome down along this ol' highway
Darlin' I ain't stayin' here
I don't intend to stay
you may not want me I'm comin' home anyway

When the sun comes creepin'
over the mountain side
I at least lay down and tell myself I tried
I ain't like somebody gonna sit
in no ditch and cry

I been gone too long
too long gone, too long
Travelin' hard I just can't get back home
it's hard to believe I done all that much wrong

Too long gone
too long gone, too long
Travelin' hard, I just can't get back home
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong
It's hard to believe I done all that much wrong
