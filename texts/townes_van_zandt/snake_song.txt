You can't hold me
I'm too slippery
I do no sleepin'
I get lonely
you can touch me
if you want to
I got poison
I just might bite you

Lie in circles
on the sunlight
shine like diamonds
on a dark night
ain't no mercy
in my smilin'
only fangs and
sweet beguiling

Future, he don't
try to find me
skin I been through
dies behind me
solid hollow
wrapped in hatred
not a drop of
venom wasted

You can slip in
try to find me
hold your breath and
flat deny me
it makes no difference
to my thinkin'
I'll be here when
you start sinkin'.
