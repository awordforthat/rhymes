Blue wind's blown my dreams away
my darling's flown and she's gone to stay
all I got now is yesterday
and I don't know what to do

I guess I'll go downtown and see
just what downtown can do for me
maybe set my lonesome free
or maybe let me go

I loved her true and I told her so
I ask her too and she told me no
she said she had somewhere to go
and then she said good-bye

I wonder how long it can go on
how long I'll sing this same old song
I wonder which one done us wrong
which one forgot to try

I loved her true and I told her so
I ask her too and she told me no
she said she had somewhere to go
and then she said good-bye
