Don't go saying I'm leaving you
thinking I never got close enough to stay
time runs in, and then runs out
starts again and it's always been that way
you're gonna drown tomorrow
if you cry to many tears for yesterday
tomorrow's half of all you've got
so treat him good, 'cause when I'm gone, he'll stay

I won't be forgetting you
you won't be forgetting me, I know
if memory comes a summer cloud
rains her sweetness down to me below
I see you like you look right now
maybe wonder why I had to go
but heaven is the way she is
rain falls and rivers flow

So here's to feelin' good
here's to feelin' bad
here's to bein' thankful
sorry for the pleasures that we had
and autumn days and window panes
God, forgive us if you feel decieved
the clock don't know you like I do
and it's only him or me you got to believe
