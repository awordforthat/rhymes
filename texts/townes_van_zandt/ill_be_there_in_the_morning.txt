There's no stronger wind than the one that blows
down a lonesome railroad line
No prettier sight than looking back
on a town you left behind
There is nothin' that's as real
as a love that's in my mind

Close your eyes
I'll be here in the morning
close your eyes
I'll be here for a while

There's lots of things along the road
I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind
and tell myself I'm free
but your softest whisper's louder
than the highways call to me

All the mountains and the rivers
and the valleys can't compare
to your blue lit dancin' eyes
and yellow shining hair
I could never hit the open road
and leave you layin' there

Lay your head back easy, love,
close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you
when the sun comes on the rise
I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails
and the lonesome bluejay cries.
