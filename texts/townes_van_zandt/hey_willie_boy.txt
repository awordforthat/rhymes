Hey Willie boy what you gonna do
when the wind blows cold
the moon turns blue
Build me a fire
gonna dance and sing
a little bit of winter don't mean a thing
a little bit of winter don't mean a thing

Hey Willie when the birds arrive
the flowers bloom
while the clouds float by
Tell my puppies
and my turtles and things
all Gods children need a little spring
all Gods children need a little spring

Hey Willie boy where you gonna go
when the grass gets sticky
and the wind blows slow
Down to the river
gonna jump right in
a little bit of summer can't be no sin
a little bit of summer can't be no sin

Hey Willie how you gonna feel
when the leaves turn gold
beneath your heels
Twirl and spin never gonna fall
fallin just won't do at all
no that wouldn't do at all

Hey Willie boy how you gonna feel
Hey Willie boy where you gonna go
Hey Willie boy what you gonna do
It's time to go to sleep right now
It's time to go to sleep right now
