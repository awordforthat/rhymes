I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
you know she cools me with her breathin'
chases away those howlin' bottles of wine

She fits just like my guitar
man, she's near as tall as me
She fits just like my guitar
she's near as tall as me
she lives way out the D train
but she's Texas as can be

She got a home-spun disposition
man, she's just as gentle as you please
she got a home-spun disposition
man, she's just as gentle as you please
she got arms just like two rattle snakes
legs just like a billow in the breeze

I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I got a brand new companion
man, I'm gonna do my best this time
I want to trace her with my body
I want to track her with my mind
