I'll play upon my violin
until the mountains ring
of lonely laughter blindly thrown
and cause an endless arc of strings
the skies are sad
they're dancin' to a silent symphony
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singing

The hall is filled to every corner
by a tinkling hint of chimes
a melody careens and crumbles
leaving just a trace behind
a rhythm [palter and] faintly fails
the silver on its wings
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singing

The cymbals flash, the drums they crash
the trumpets rise the song
the brass beton plucks its diamonds
from a glittering wall of almost dawn
The crystal chords they slash the wind
in humble majesty
and the velvet voices all shall join
the singing
