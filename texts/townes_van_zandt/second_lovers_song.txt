You're wakin' next to me
tears splash across the sun
you whisper soft to me
that I ain't the only one
to breathe your yellow hair
caress your bosom fair
Do you think I really care?
Do you think it matters?

What do your feelin's mean?
Do you think I'd love more
if you stood pure and clean
of those you'd known before
Would your words be sweeter then
upon November's wind
if you began again
could your smile be softer?
Would your eyes more brightly shine?
Would your laughter be so tender
if you'd been only mine
for as long as you remember?

I don't want tears from you
don't build your love on shame
all what we've done is through
and all we can do remains
my lady can't you see
I love not jealously
but for all you are to me
and all you'll be tomorrow
