If I had a dollar bill
Yes I believe I surely will
Go to town and drink my fill
Early in the morning

Little darlin' she's a red haired thing
Man she makes my legs to sing
Gonna buy her a diamond ring
Early in the mornin'

Mother was a golden girl
Slit her throat just to get her pearls
Cast myself into a world
Before a bunch of swine

It's a long way down the Harlan road
Busted back and a heavy load
Won't get through to save my soul
Early in the mornin'

I always been a gambling man
Roll them bones with either hand
Seven is the promised land
Early in the mornin'

Whiskey be my dyin' bed
Tell me where to lay my head
Not with me is all she said
Early in the mornin'

If I had a dollar bill
Yes I believe I surely will
Go to town and drink my fill
Early in the mornin'
