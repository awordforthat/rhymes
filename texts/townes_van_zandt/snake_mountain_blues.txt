Mr. Ten Dollar man
Let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liqour, Lord
You'll roll to the ground
But you come around here
With your money in your hand
Taste of my woman
You die where you stand

Snake Mountain blues
They got me down low
I could die in the morning
But noone would know
My woman come 'round
My body she'd find
Go down to Dundee
Have her a time

Snake Mountain's
Gonna crumble Lord
And fall from the sky
Before that woman of mine
Stops tellin' her lies
If I'd die Lord she'd weep
She'd weep and she'd mourn
Soon as I's buried
Forget I'd been born

Love of black-skinned woman
She won't do you no wrong
Slow to start moanin'
She don't moan for long
A yellow-headed woman
Brings you nothin' but pain
Take all you give her
She leaves only shame

My Daddy, Lord he rides
On a long holy train
First winds of winter
I'll see him again
It's farewell to this yellow
Headed misery I've known
Snake Mountain's callin'
Callin' me home

Snake Mountain blues
They got me down low
I could die in the mornin'
No one would know
My woman come around
My body she'd find
Go down to Dundee
Have her a time
