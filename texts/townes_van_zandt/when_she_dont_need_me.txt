When she don't need me
it makes me crazy
she say rest easy
and it makes me lazy
but when she please me
she please me all night long

My friends are leavin'
she say don't worry
they're only leavin'
there is no parting
you will be lonely
I will be here with you

On the winds of darkness
the light is soring
and chains are bonded
freedom is singing
cling to the darkness
until you've turned to song

The blues shall wash me
and sun shall dry me
the world will hide me
but she will find me
and when she find me
she will take me home

When she don't need me
it makes me crazy
she say rest easy
and it makes me lazy
but when she please me
she please me all night long
