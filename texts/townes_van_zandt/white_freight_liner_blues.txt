I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whine
I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whine

White freight liner
won't you steal away my mind
Ah, New Mexico ain't bad, Lord
and the people there they treat you kind
and the people there they treat you kind

Well, it's bad news from Houston
half my friends are dying
Well, it's bad news from Houston
half my friends are dying

Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble
till I get back to where I came
Ah, Lord, I'm gonna ramble
till I get back to where I came

I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whine
I'm goin out on the highway
listen to them big trucks whine
