Snow don't fall
on summers time
wind don't blow
below the sea
my loves lies
'neath frozen skies
and waits in sweet
repose for me

Her eyes did laugh
her lips did sing
her legs did roll
my soul to bring
her hair did curl
and her thoughts unfurled
like birds upon
the wings of spring

my love I need not see
to know she cast her glance at me

Snow don't fall
on summers time
wind don't blow
below the sea
my loves lies
'neath frozen skies
and waits in sweet
repose for me
