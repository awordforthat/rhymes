I'm goin' out to Denver
see if I can't find
I'm goin' out to Denver
see if I can't find
that lovin' Colorado girl of mine

The promise in her smile
shames the mountains tall
The promise in her smile
shames the mountains tall
she bring the sun to shining
tell the rain to fall

It's been a long time, mama,
since I heard you call my name
Ah, been a long time
since I heard you call my name
I got to see my Colorado girl again

Be there tomorrow
Mama, don't you cry
Be there tomorrow
Now, mama, don't you cry
I got to kiss these
lonesome Texas blues good-bye

I'm goin' out to to Denver
see if I can't find
I'm goin' out to to Denver
see if I can't find
that lovin' Colorado girl of mine
that lovin' Colorado girl of mine
