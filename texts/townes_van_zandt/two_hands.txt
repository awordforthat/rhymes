I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heavens door
I got one heart
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore

Well now, this old world sometimes it does get lonesome
and it's many a grown man has hung his head and cried
down in your soul there's one that won't desert you
ain't it fine to have the Saviour by your side

Now the Lord resides inside a house of golden
and faith is the door and love is the key
and warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows
and that light, my friend, it shines on you and me

When the wind blows on that faithful morning
and I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me
I'll be batheing in the glory of the throne

I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heavens door
I got one heart
I gonna fill it up with up Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore
