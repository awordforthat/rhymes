Mr. Gator he's a-slidin' down the bayou
Mr. Buzzard he's a-glidin' through the air
Mr. Turtle he's a-hittin' the highway
But I ain't goin' nowhere

I ain't leavin you love
Ain't leavin you love
Not for heaven above babe
I ain't leavin you love

The rich man's got him an airplane
Cruising through the traffic jam
A poor man's got him a Chevrolet
I'm stayin' right where I am

Hannibal he was a mountain man
Cleopatra did her dancin' down the Nile
Lucky Lindy made it all the way to gay Paree
I'm stayin right here awhile

I ain't leavin you love
Ain't leavin you love
Not for heaven above babe
I ain't leavin you love
