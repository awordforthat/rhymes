Baby hit the back door breathin' real heavy
said the boys in the alley wouldn't leave her alone
Mama did her make-up in a terrible hurry
She finally got ready but the boys were gone
Mama don't you worry, night's aproachin'
there's a hole in heaven where some sin slips through
Close your eyes and dream real steady
maybe just a little will spill on you

The dark don't lie
and dreams come true
could be a few will see you through

Old lady Rose, lookin' down her nose
at lonely Miss Lily hiding in the hall
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over
Rosy's just waitin' for the ax to fall
Show me off on the way to town
the sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases
gonna dance in their faces
when the guitar sounds

It won't be long
I won't be gone
I've been leaning toward the shadows all along

Those in the know say how it goes
you plan on reapin' you better sow
you plan on sleepin' you better keep movin'
sleepin ain't allowed around here you know
Tell me please when the rollin's over
me and my baby gonna have some fun
Bury our backs in a bed of clover
smile in style while the sun goes down

Snake eyes cry
and boxcars sigh
Seven's stuck in the middle just wonderin' why

The dark don't lie
and dreams come true
all it takes is one or two
maybe just a few will see you through
maybe just b few will see you throagh
