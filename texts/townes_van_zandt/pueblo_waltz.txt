Sunrise comes and I don't know why
living loves and the day does fly
soon the moon and baby and I
will be lyin' side by side

How many of your skies are blue?
How much of your love is true?
Where did you get them eyes of green?
I'm knowin' you know just what I mean

If I have to go I won't be long
maybe we'll move to Tennessee
leave these Texas blues behind
see Susanna and Guy

Well, I'm in this cold room all alone
I guess I'll try the telephone
it'll be busy or she won't be home
tomorrow is another day

Sunrise comes and I don't know why
living loves and the day does fly
soon the moon and baby and I
will be lyin' side by side
