Ribbons of love
please keep me true sane
until I reach home on the morrow
never never to wander again
I'm weak and I'm weary of sorrow

London to Dublin
Australia to Perth
I gazed at your sky
I tasted your earth
sung out my heart
for what it was worth
never again shall I ramble

There's nowhere left
in this world where to go
my arms, my legs they're a-tremblin'
thoughts both clouded and blue as the sky
not even worth the rememberin'

Now as I stumble
and reel to my bed
all that I've done
all that I've said
means nothin' to me
I'd soon as be dead
all of this world be forgotten

No words of comfort
no words of advice
nothin' to offer a stranger
gone the love, gone the spite
it just doesn't matter no longer

My sky's getting far
the ground's gettin' close
my self goin' crazy
the way that it does
I'll lie on my pillow
and sleep if I must
Too late to wish I'd been stronger
too late to wish I'd been stronger
