Ain't much I ain't tried
fast livin' slow suicide
then a-runnin' in a place to hide
just looking for you

My friends they all agree
ain't many a fool like me
I just tell them wait and see
go looking for you

Looking low and looking high
looking far and looking wide
try to tell myself that I'm fine
but it just ain't true
it just ain't true
I'm still looking for you
still looking for you

From the shadow of the darkest pine
to the edge of the sweet sunshine
I keep looking till they make you mine
looking for you

When the curtain tumbles down
I'll be somewhere hanging round
with my heart laid on the ground
just looking for you

Looking low and looking high
looking far and looking wide
try to tell myself that I tried
but it just ain't true
it just won't do
I'm still looking for you
still looking for you
