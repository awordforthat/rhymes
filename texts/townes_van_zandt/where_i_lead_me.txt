Where i lead me i will travel
Where i need me i will call me
I'm no fool, i'll be ready
God knows i will be
And in the meantime make a little money
And buy a little mercy

Met this morning, now he loves me
Say's he loves me
It must be easy, look around you
all around you
But you see the motion, you're not movin'
You don't know how to hold on
Just keep it loose
Don't get excited, it'll pass before long

Now one is goin' one is stayin'
One is silent one is saying'
Here's your coat, take care of yourself
Sorry you're leavin'
A little sad you're all i had
Will you be returnin'

The boys upstairs are gettin' hungry
You can shout in the wind about how it will be
or you can clench your fist, shake your head
And head to the country
I got no doubt about it my friend
That's where they'll find me
That's where they're gonna find me

Ask the boys down in the gutter
Now they won't lie cause you don't matter
The street's just fine if you're good and blind
But it ain't where you belong
Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
and carry yourself home
Roll down your sleeves, pick up your money
and carry yourself home
