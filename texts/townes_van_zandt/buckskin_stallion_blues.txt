I heard her sing in tongues of silver
I heard her cry on a summer storm
I loved her, but she did not know it
so I don't think about her anymore
Now she's gone, and I can't believe it
so I don't think about her anymore

If three and four was seven only
where would that leave one and two?
If love can be and still be lonely
where does that leave me and you?
Time there was, and time there will be
where does that leave me and you?

If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away.
If I had a flyin' schooner
I'd sail into the light of day
If I had your love forever
sail into the light of day

Pretty songs and pretty places
places that I've never seen
pretty songs and pretty faces
tell me what their laughter means
some look like they'll cry forever
tell me what their laughter means.

If I had a buckskin stallion
I'd tame him down and ride away.
If I had a golden galleon
I'd sail into the light of day
If I had your love forever
sail into the light of day
