The old woman finally caught me
Sneakin' 'round her cave
Her hair looked just like barbwire, boys
and her smile just like the grave
She asked me could I stay awhile
I said I'd better go
She slid her arm around my neck
and sweetly whispered no

It's cold and dark and lonely here
as soon enough you'll see
I'm oh so glad you stumbled in
I've been cravin' company
I cannot stay too long you know
I left some friends at home
Don't you fret about your friends
Down here we're all alone

What about my mother
I can't just leave her there to mourn
You don't have to think about her
Just forget you were ever born
I'll disappoint my father
you know he worked so hard for me
If you have to pay your father back
Just send him some misery

I'll miss, I said, a girl I know
I can't just leave there to pine
she's still got plenty of men to go
I'm sure she'll do just fine
What about my little boy
She said, he's just like you
Let a few short years roll by
He'll end up down here too

Then her pale green eyes began to glow
she placed her hand on mine
she smiled and said don't worry
you'll get used to me in time
As her cold tongue flickered toward
I spun myself around
made a dive for the passageway
but the walls come crashing down

Now her eyes were the only light
my fevered brain could see
but I tore myself away from them
and fell down to my knees
I've come too far, I can't get back
I beseeched the Gods of men
fame and fortune just laughed at me
then silence once again

A whisper deep within
embrace the God of Love
I lifted my face and through the tears
I saw light fall from above

I hurled myself into the wall
I ripped and clawed my way
through the stinkin', clingin' loam
back to the light of day
I crawled out into the wind again
the sky upon my face
I heard the earth sigh patiently
as it slid back into place

Now I'm back among the ones I love
I'm loved by them in turn
and it's only on the darkest night
that green eyed memory burns
So walk my friends, in the light of day
don't go sneakin' 'round no holes
there justmight be something down there
wants to gobble up your soul
