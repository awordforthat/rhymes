Greensboro woman don't you smile on me
I do not feel like being comforted
Anyway I'll be home soon
For once ther's someone waitin' there
And if you don't mind
I'll just think on her instead

Your face she's a picture babe
but pictures ain't what I crave
I don't feel this way most generally
I just put a thousand miles 'tween me
And where my thoughts do lie
I'd thank you kindly baby
If you'd kindly let me be

Your car she's smooth and fast
Babe your bourbon's fine
But I ain't feelin free and clear today
Texas lovin' layin' on my mind
I couldn't do you right babe
Spinnin' 'round this way

So Greensboro woman don't you smile on me
I do not feel like being comforted
Anyway I'll be home soon
For once there's someone waitin' there
And if you don't mind
I'll just think on her instead
