Well, I've been turnstyled,
junkpiled
and railroaded too
I've been laid low
but don't you know
I'm still in love with you
I've been took down many a road
if anybody says I ain't they lie
but ain't got no plans
except to be your man
and love you till I die

Well you got me under your spell
won't you tell
me all 'bout your wonderful charms
I got time to burn
and a lot to learn
mama, take me in your lovin' arms
Well, I know that probably
you feel quite oddly
'bout the words you hear me say
but if you hold me tight
it's gonna be all right
mama, chase my blues away
