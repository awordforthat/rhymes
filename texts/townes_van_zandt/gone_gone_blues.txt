Well, little darling she ain't mean me no harm
you know, she loved me all night long
now she's gone, gone

Well, little darling in a dress so red
now she's gone, man

I'm stuck in Chicago, Illinois
let me tell you, boys
she's gone, gone

I do believe she gone a mobil deal
I do believe she made a fool of me
she's gone now

Little darling, won't you stay friend
I want to do them things again
Ah, gone, gone

you know, she loved me all night long
you know, she didn't mean me no wrong
now she's gone, gone
