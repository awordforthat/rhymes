I'm building a houseboat in heaven
to sail those deep and holy seas
I'm building a houseboat in heaven
and it's welcome aboard you sweet peace

The bow she is made of solid silver
and the hall she is made of solid gold
she ain't much long the line's a-floating
but she's yours, babe, to have and to hold

I rode my old guitar to heaven
but heaven didn't feel too much like home
so I'm headed out on to them lonesome oceans
in my rubystudded houseboat to roam
