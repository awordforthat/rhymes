Come away with me,
my little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
that I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if you're blue don't cry
just wander right downtown
you can find your delta mama waitin' there
Well, I thought you knew that I
would never let you down
I can ease your mind and take away your cares

Come away with me,
my little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
that I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile

Well, if the grass goes brown
don't you hang your head too low
Well, there ain't no need for you to sit and pine
If you'll just ask around
I'm sure someone will know
just exactly what it takes to get you back to feelin fine

Well, if you don't know by now
what I've been tryin' so hard to say
Well my delta boy I'm afraid you're up to tight
but you take it slow and somehow
you come meandering out my way
and I'll take you in my arms and make it right

Ah, come away with me,
my little delta boy
I wanna be your delta mama for awhile
And if you stay you'll see
that I bring you lots of joy
I turn those little teardrops to a smile
