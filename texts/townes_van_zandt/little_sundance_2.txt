When I'm with you, babe,
I just can't be lonely
When I'm away, babe,
I think of you only
What can I do, babe,
to get back to you, babe,
I do anything that you say

The night she is a sapphire
full of blue desire
follow her love fire
higher and higher
What can I do, babe,
to stay her with you babe
at least till the east turn to grey

Just you and me, girl,
the stars and the real whirl
spinning the minutes away

The darkness is passing
she's never long lasting
but my love ain't leaving
through hurtin' or pleasin'
I am tellin' you true, babe,
ask me to do, babe,
I'll trade all my treasures for you

The daylight are flashing
our hearts could be laughing
if only you wanted them to
for just you and me, girl,
the sun shine and turmoil
will spill from a basket of blue
