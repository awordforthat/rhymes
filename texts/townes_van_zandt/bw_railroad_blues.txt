I'm gonna lay my troubles on a railroad track
I'm gonna ride I ain't lookin' back
tried to stop but I can't unpack
gotta get used to the clickety-clack
the big ol' wheels and the smokin' stack
Ah babe I gotta go
Babe I gotta go

Loved you honey heart and soul
I swear you're the sweetest thing I know
I loved you true and I told you so
I told you too come time to go
I'll be gone with any ol' wind that blows
Ah babe I just can't stay
and it's bound to be that way

There's lots of things I'd like to see
from the mountains to the shining sea
up in the sky where the wind blows free
to the cities down below
Babe I just don't know
I got trouble, trouble in my soul
I got trouble in my soul

I'm gonna lay my trouble on a railroad track
I'm gonna ride, I ain't lookin back
I tried to stop but I can't unpack
go to sleep with the clickety-clack
the big ol' wheels and the smokin' stack
Babe I'm bound to go
I got trouble in my soul
I got trouble trouble in my soul
