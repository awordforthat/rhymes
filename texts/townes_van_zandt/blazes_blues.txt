I gotta guitar all my own
I gotta quarter for the telephone
I ain't headed down this highway all alone
One two three and maybe four
Honey, they're knockin' on my door
I know you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

Got no daddy but I got a ma
think she lives in Arkansas
maybe I'll go see her some old day
It ain't like she'd really care
it ain't like she'd pay no fare
but I might just blow on through there anyway

Headed down to Alabam
cause some trouble if I can
Aw, buddy, would you like to come along?
It's a place I never been
and you know I could use a friend
they say they'll give us twenty bucks a song

I gotta guitar all my own
I gotta quarter for the telephone
I ain't headed down this highway all alone
One two three and maybe four
Honey, they're knockin' on my door
you know I'm gonna miss you when I'm gone
